# Database Standard Guidelines

</div>

<div align = "justify">

Structured Query Language (SQL) is specifically a domain specific language used to manage relational databases, and typically
follows a [declarative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming). There are no universal standard,
thus it is often becomes a challenge to maintain a large database where every developer is using their own convention of
writing style. This **guide is specifically designed to maintain one uniform structure** - and the key - is to stick to the
convention for easier maintenance and uniformity across the large number of tables defined.

The guidelines are a design document (inspired from [PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/)) providing information to
the development community, or describing a new feature or its processes or environment. This improves the code readibility
and also improves maintainbility.
