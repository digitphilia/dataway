# SQL Syntax Convention

</div>

<div align = "justify">

SQL follow a loose paradigm, and typically does not have a case sensitivity. However, to maintain consistency and improve
code readiability, the following convention must be maintained.

  * Always use uppercase for reserved keywords like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, etc.
  * Follow an indentation of two spaces in the code and do not use "tab" indentation - this may sometimes create an issue
    in programming language like Python which are restricted to tab vs. space indentation.
