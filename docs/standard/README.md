<h1 align = "center">Database Standard Guidelines</h1>

<div align = "justify">

The guidelines are a design document (inspired from [PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/)) providing information to
the development community, or describing a new feature or its processes or environment. This improves the code readibility
and also improves maintainbility.

## Table of Contents

  1. [**Database Nomenclature**](README.md) - Information about the nomenclature system, purpose, objective and any other
    relevant details.
  2. [**Naming Convention**](NAMING_CONVENTION.md) - The naming convention to be followed. This includes table names, column names and/or
    constraint names etc. If a PR commit does not follow the convention they are either rejected or resend for verification.

    schemas are inteconnected - please refer to this document for convention.
