<h1 align = "center">Database Standard Guidelines</h1>

<div align = "justify">

The guidelines are a design document (inspired from [PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/)) providing information to
the development community, or describing a new feature or its processes or environment. This improves the code readibility
and also improves maintainbility.
